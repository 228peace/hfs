# To do
- fix: array for plugins has layout problems (see download-manager) 
- frontend: "download zip" should offer a third button like "select some files"
- plugins' log, accessible in admin
- fix: cannot switch off https and switch on http at the same time 
- fix: chrome is prompting to save credentials without username because of login's double-form
- admin: check + update
- frontend: hide closer button on login dialog accessing a protected resource, as it's no use
- easier nat life
  - show public ip use, https://github.com/sindresorhus/public-ip
  - configure router with upnp. If it fails, suggest a guide. https://github.com/indutny/node-nat-upnp
  - offer ddns registration/update
- use dialogs instead of side-forms on mobile (admin/fs+accounts)
- blacklist of plugins (as a temporary measure until GitHub's intervention)
